# Multiplayer-Noughts-and-Crosses

This seemed like the next step for any sort of game, to be able to play with people over the internet(in particular under lockdown times).

I am trying to use socket.io to play noughts and crosses through the internet with chat to talk to them as well.

Needs a bit of work to be deployed.
